# animation-track-2

This is a custom animation track that uses the Motor6D's transform property to animate characters. The main goal of creating this is to enable the use of animation tracks traditionally, without needing to upload the animations to Roblox.
Personally, I got tired of uploading animations to each group that I plan on publishing my games to, so I tried to make a solution.


## Methods (Subject to change)

### Track:Play()

#### There's other methods, I just haven't bothered to add their functionality yet, the core functionality is not yet done in the least.
